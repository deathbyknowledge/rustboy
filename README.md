# RUSTBOY.
An original GameBoy emulator written in Rust (Because there weren't enough)

This is part of a series of challenges made to myself. This will never be the best performant emulator nor the best written Rust program, but the goal is that it WILL be an **emulator** and a _Rust_ program. I want to learn both of those.

The challenge side of this is to NOT read/watch any "code along" tutorials. I'm allowing myself to read stack overflow (mostly on bitwise operation problems), any gbdev docs that are not "look at this code". Also try not to look at other emulators code (I did once... :( but it was more of a Rust program architecture dilemma).

## Usage
Not even close to being a working emulator... but you will need to provide your own ROM file. E.g. `cargo run -- /path/to/rom`
